# Ants vs Doodlebugs Simulation
Two-dimensional predator-prey simulation. In this simulation the prey are ants and the pred-ators are doodlebugs. These critters live in a world composed of a 20 Ã— 20 grid of cells. Only one critter may occupy a cell at a time. The grid is enclosed, so a critter is not allowed to move off the edges of the world. Time is simulated in time steps. Each critter performs some action every time step. Ants are represented by the X symbol, whilst the Doodlebugs are represented by the - symbol.
